Difficulty: Medium

Given an integer n, return true if it is possible to represent n as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return false.
An integer y is a power of three if there exists an integer x such that y == 3x.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: true
Explanation: 12 = 31 + 32

Example 2:
Input: n = 91
Output: true
Explanation: 91 = 30 + 32 + 34

Example 3:
Input: n = 21
Output: false

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 107
