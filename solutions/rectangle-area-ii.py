Problem Statement: Rectangle Area II

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area-ii
Tags: ['Segment Tree', 'Line Sweep']
Difficulty: Hard

We are given a list of (axis-aligned) rectangles. Each rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2] , where (xi1, yi1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (xi2, yi2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the ith rectangle.
Find the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: As illustrated in the picture.

Example 2:
Input: rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
Output: 49
Explanation: The answer is 1018 modulo (109 + 7), which is (109)2 = (-7)2 = 49.

 
Constraints:

1 <= rectangles.length <= 200
rectanges[i].length = 4
0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 109
The total area covered by all rectangles will never exceed 263 - 1 and thus will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
