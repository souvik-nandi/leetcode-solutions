Tags: ['Math', 'Binary Search']
Difficulty: Hard

A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.
Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 6
Example 3:
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 4
Output: 10
Example 4:
Input: n = 3, a = 6, b = 4
Output: 8

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109
2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104
