Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-squareful-arrays
Tags: ['Math', 'Backtracking', 'Graph']
Difficulty: Hard

Given an array nums of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.
Return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful.  Two permutations perm1 and perm2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that perm1[i] != perm2[i].
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,17,8]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,2]
Output: 1

 
Note:

1 <= nums.length <= 12
0 <= nums[i] <= 109
