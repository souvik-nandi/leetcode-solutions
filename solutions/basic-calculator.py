Difficulty: Hard

Given a string s representing an expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it.
Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
s represents a valid expression.
