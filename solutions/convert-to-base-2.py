Problem Statement: Convert to Base -2

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-to-base-2
Tags: ['Math']
Difficulty: Medium

Given a number n, return a string consisting of "0"s and "1"s that represents its value in base -2 (negative two).
The returned string must have no leading zeroes, unless the string is "0".
 

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: "110"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 = 2


Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: "111"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 + (-2) ^ 0 = 3


Example 3:
Input: n = 4
Output: "100"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 = 4

 
Note:

0 <= n <= 109
