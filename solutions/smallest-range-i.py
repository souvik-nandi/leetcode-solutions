Problem Statement: Smallest Range I

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-i
Tags: ['Math']
Difficulty: Easy

Given an array nums of integers, for each integer nums[i] we may choose any x with -k <= x <= k, and add x to nums[i].
After this process, we have some array result.
Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of result and the minimum value of result.
 



Example 1:
Input: nums = [1], k = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: result = [1]


Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,10], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: result = [2,8]


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,6], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: result = [3,3,3] or result = [4,4,4]

 
Note:

1 <= nums.length <= 10000
0 <= nums[i] <= 10000
0 <= k <= 10000
